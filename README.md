# Disassembler
C++ class for disassembling Intel x86 assembly.

### Disclaimer
This is not production-worthy code! View this simply as a proof-of-concept.

In addition, I'd like to apologize to anyone who reads this code. I wrote this a few years ago when I was about 14-years-old. When I look at this code now, I want to cry. I am going to try to improve this code later on but it may too big of a task for right now. I am putting it on Github nonetheless, as it is an important project of my past and I don't want to lose it.
