# Disassembler
C++ class for disassembling Intel x86 assembly.

### Disclaimer
This is not production-worthy code! View this simply as a proof-of-concept.

In addition, I'd like to apologize to anyone who reads this code. I wrote this a few years ago when I was about 14-years-old. When I look at this code now, I want to cry. I am going to try to improve this code later on but it may too big of a task for right now. I am putting it on Github nonetheless, as it is an important project of my past and I don't want to lose it.

### Initialization
```C++
Disassembler();
Disassembler(char * input, int length);
```
A `Disassembler` can be initialized by default--where the buffer must be set later--or by including the buffer and the length right away. The buffer is copied into the object. (This may change in the future.)

### Disassemble
```C++
string Disassemble(int startingAddress = 0x0, int length = 0xFFFFFFFF, int instructions = 0xFFFFFFFF, int flags = 0x0, int baseAddress = 0x0)
```
The `Disassemble` method converts the buffer into Intel x86 Assembly language. 

The output can be a string (specified through the `flags` with `DISASSEMBLE_STRING`), printed to the standard output stream (specified through the `flags` with `DISASSEMBLE_PRINT`), or neither (leaving `flags` empty). 

The `startingAddress` tells the method where to start within the buffer relative to the beginning. 

The `length` tells the method how many bytes to read from the buffer. 

The `instruction` tells the method how many instructions to disassemble. 

The `baseAddress` tells the disassembler what the address of the first instruction should be when printed to a string or the standard output stream. 

### Setters
```C++
void SetBuffer(char * input, int length)
```
If the buffer needs to be changed after instantiation or has not been set yet, this method can be called. It sets `input` as the buffer to be disassembled and `length` to the size of the buffer. This method is called by the second constructor.

### Deinitialization
```C++
~Disassembler()
```
Since the buffer is copied into the object, this must be freed when destructed. This is accomplished by this method.

### Example
```C++
#include "Disassembler.h"
#include "PortableExecutable.h"

int main()
{
	PortableExecutable pe("Test.exe");

	Disassembler disasm((char *)pe.GetSection(".text")->Data, pe.GetSection(".text")->Length);

	disasm.Disassemble(pe.GetHeader<EXECUTABLE_OPTIONAL_HEADER>(OPTIONAL_HEADER)->AddressOfEntryPoint - pe.GetHeader<EXECUTABLE_SECTION_HEADER>((pe.GetSectionNumber(".text") << 16) | SECTION_HEADER)->VirtualAddress, -1, 20, DISASSEMBLER_PRINT, pe.GetHeader<EXECUTABLE_SECTION_HEADER>(SECTION_HEADER | (pe.GetSectionNumber(".text") << 16))->VirtualAddress);

	return 0;
}turn 0;
}
```
This example takes a sample executable called "Test.exe" and loads the ".text" section into the `Disassembler` and disassembles it. The `startingAddress` is equal to the `AddressOfEntryPoint` minus the `VirtualAddress` of the ".text" section (because `VirtualAddress` is the zero of the buffer to be disassembled). 20 instructions are disassembled and the `baseAddress` is equal to the `VirtualAddress` of the ".text" section.

### Output

0x00002a29: c2 04 00           ret      0004h
...
```
Since the executable I selected in the above example went to a jump table, I just picked a random function in "Test.exe" to show as example output.
